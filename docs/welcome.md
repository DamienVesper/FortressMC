# **IP: play.fortressmc.cf**

Welcome to FortressMC! To start your adventure, join our Minecraft server using the following IP: play.fortressmc.cf and join the Discord to get to know our community. If you'd like, you can also open our server dynmap to locate other towns that may interest you or look for a specific place that you might want to settle down, and start a new town.

There's one thing key similarity from this server to the real world apart from them sharing the planet Earth: money!

Money is a key factor in many servers, and in ours especially. We use a virtual currency, that you can get from voting, selling items on /ah or with chest shops to other players, or selling diamonds. Money shapes the world, and your town. It costs an upfront fee of $7.5k to found a town, for those interested in founding a town. If you want to join one, ask the town mayor. Don't think it won't cost however, as some mayors may charge a tax on their citizens, or charge for a plot for you to start building a home. Establish yourself in the community, and try to climb to the top!
